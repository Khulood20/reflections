<p> For this week’s reflection, I read about the entire design process of “Why cats and dogs ..?”. It is a visualization by Nadieh Bremer in collaboration with Google Trends. This work aims to explore what are the questions that people google search to understand their pet’s behavior. In particular, the 4400 questions that begin with the “Why” word.</p> 
<p> The designer started her post by explaining how they decided to go with this idea by proposing different topics and narrowing it down to one. Then she began to think about the concept from different angles. After she decided which aspects to handle, she moved to the design phase, where  Bremer sketched her idea roughly, then refined it until she decided the final structure, “sentence tree,” presenting the commonly asked questions. Bremer organized her design thoughts and sent them to the team for approval. After that, Bremer worked on getting the data she needed where she inspected different ways to create the data structure required. Then,  she tested it by visualizing it. </p>
<p> In the programming phase, the designer tried different visualization approaches; some failed, and one, of course, won. When deciding the suitable method, she kept in mind the audience. Finally, she moved to the styling phase, where she tested different color palettes and other styles to choose the most suitable ones to achieve her goals. </p>
<p> Reading the designer’s project flow gives an idea about the entire design process of a real data visualization project and how to explore and test different approaches. More importantly, it makes you aware of the potential obstacles and how to overcome them to present the visualization suitably. </p>
